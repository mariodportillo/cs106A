In this repository, I have collected all the projects and assignments I worked on during my fall class at Stanford University. The class revolved around Programming Methodology and was an introduction to programming. The entire course revolved around Python. We learned the basics behind python and were introduced to later complicated topics such as hashtables, mapping, and list comprehension.
