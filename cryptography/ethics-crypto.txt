This is a short ethics question based on the ethics
lecture that goes with the crypto assignment.
Please type your answer below, and submit this file as
part of your assignment.

Suppose Alice and Bob are US citizens and Alice sends an SMS message to Bob through Verizon.

1. If the police obtain a warrant and make a request to Verizon, can Verizon provide them with a copy of the message - yes or no? - one word answer:
Yes
2. Suppose instead Alice sends a message to Bob using an end-to-end encrypted messaging, and the bytes of the message flow through Verizon. Does Verizon have a copy of the plaintext of the message to provide to the police? Explain briefly.

Your answer:

Verizon would not have access to plaintext if the messages were encrypted end-to-end. Due to only Alice and Bob having the keys to decrypt the message they would be the only ones able to actually read the messages. Verizon would be unable to
make sense of the message as it would be encrypted and since only Bob and Alice have the keys they are the only ones who could read the messages.
